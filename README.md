This page is a Countdown to Christmas. It has a drawer that pulls out, and navigational links to the NORAD Santa Tracker (which activates in December, but the page is still there), and the ThinkGeek Gifts page. The button for the drawer is an image of a present. When the countdown is complete, the text changes to say 'Merry Christmas!' Under the countdown is some text and an image which are static. When the screen is smaller, the text all wraps so that it is not overlapping, and the navigational buttons in the header disappear.
